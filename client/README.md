# REACT APOLLO PRISMA GRAPHQL MYSQL

The goal of this project was to be used as base to write a series of articles [on my blog](https://radinax.github.io/React-Personal-Blog-Gatsby/) which goes step by step, from theory to building the server and client sides of this application which consists in performing GET and POST requests using GraphQL.

We used Apollo on the client side which is a state management library like Redux but much simple to use. It works similar in that you need to add a Provider and instead of passing a store, you pass a new client which has information about the URL you'll be performing requests to.

Said URL is generated by Prisma on the Backend, we first use [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-yoga) to generate out schema, the typeDefs and resolvers, then we use Prisma to hook up our code with the database, in this case MySQL.

To Perform POST requests we need to make the appropiate configuration in our schema, in this case we defined a **post** keyword which we use on the client side to perform the requests.
